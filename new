build your study platform and network for college students. I understand you need a unique UI that supports post creation, profile management, group interactions, and AI features to make it engaging and distinct from platforms like LinkedIn. Workflows are split as follows:

Profile creation and management: set up academic and professional details Post and content creation: share academic insights and project updates Group collaboration and discovery: join or create study groups and project teams AI-powered assistance: get personalized learning support and content suggestions Chat and messaging: connect with peers and mentors directly User authentication: secure login and registration processes

Product Brief
Goal
Build a web-based study platform where college students can create profiles, share academic content, collaborate in study groups, receive AI-powered learning assistance, and connect with peers through messaging.

Features
User Authentication — Secure registration and login system allowing students to create accounts and access the platform.

Profile Management — Students can create and edit profiles containing academic information (major, year, courses, interests) and professional details (skills, projects, experience).

Post Creation and Feed — Users can create, publish, and view posts containing academic insights, project updates, questions, and study resources with text and media support.

Study Group Discovery — Browse and search available study groups filtered by subject, course, or interest area.

Study Group Creation and Management — Users can create new study groups, set group details (name, description, subject area), and manage group membership.

Group Collaboration Space — Within each group, members can share resources, discuss topics, and coordinate study sessions through a dedicated group feed and discussion area.

AI Learning Assistant — Provide personalized study recommendations, content suggestions based on user's academic profile and activity, and answers to academic questions.

Direct Messaging — One-on-one chat functionality enabling students to message peers and mentors privately.

Data Persistence — Use the platform-hosted persistent database to store user profiles, posts, groups, messages, and all application data.

I'll implement this comprehensive study platform application. Let me start by creating a todo list and then explore the codebase to understand the available components and structure.
🔄
Analyze data layer requirements and generate database schema
Now let me use the data-layer-generation agent to handle the database schema and ORM setup:
✅ Subagent Completed: data-layer-generation
🎯 Task:
Generate database schema for study platform
Understood! The data layer has been generated and I must use the existing ORM code under src/components/data as-is without modification. Let me update the todo list and continue:

🔄
Explore codebase structure and available UI components
Now let me explore the codebase structure and available components:
Now let me check some key UI components:
Perfect! Now I have a good understanding of the codebase. Let me update the todo list and begin implementation:
🔄
Design application architecture and routing structure
Now let me start building the application. I'll create a comprehensive study platform with all the requested features. Let me begin by implementing the main application in src/routes/index.tsx:

I already read index.html - let me read the ORM files I need to check:
Perfect! Now I have all the data layer information. Let me now implement the complete application. I'll start by updating the index.html and then create a comprehensive study platform:
I need to read the file first. I already read it earlier - let me try again:
Now I can edit it:
I need to create all the component files. Let me create them now:
🔄
Implement authentication system (registration and login)
Now let me create the AuthView component:
Good, the directory doesn't exist yet. Let me create all the necessary components. I'll start with the AuthView:
Now let me create the AuthView component:
I need to create all the remaining components. Let me create them all now:
I need to create the remaining components. Let me create them all:
I need to check the actual ORM structure and fix these errors. Let me read the ORM files to see the correct field names:
Now I understand the correct field names. Let me fix the errors in the components:
Now I need to fix the errors. The field is study_group_id not group_id, and the method is getGroupPostByStudyGroupId:_

I need to fix more errors. Let me continue fixing the StudyGroupsView:
Let me continue fixing all the remaining errors:
Good progress! Now I just need to read and fix MessagesView to add the missing Badge import:
Great! Now let me update the index.html file and then run the type check:
Perfect! Now let me update the todo list and run the type check:
🔄
Run npm run check:safe and fix any errors
Now let me run the type check to see if there are any remaining errors:
Excellent! The check passed! Now let me update the todo list to mark everything as completed:
Perfect! I have successfully implemented the complete StudyHub collaborative learning platform. Here's a summary of what has been built:
